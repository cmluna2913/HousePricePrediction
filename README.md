<tb>This is a configuration file that currently contains the path to my data. 
<tb>I like to implement this file into each of my projects since it provides a
<tb>central location for key information that can be easily edited as needed.
<tb>For example, I can now easily configure the data path should I switch devices. 
<tb>In addition, I can also include api keys, usernames, passwords, etc. into this 
<tb>file. Then I can easily exclude it from the respository by including it in the
<tb>.gitignore file.
